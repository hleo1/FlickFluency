This examination

23
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,060
has almost driven me mad.

24
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,660
Not because I'm a bad student,

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,800
but because the exam was on MAGIC!

26
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,480
Time to go home!

27
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,620
It's finally over!

28

Come on let's go.

29

Ever since I fell asleep

with this pendant on three months ago,

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,840
everything has changed.

32
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,940
All everybody talks about now is magic.

33
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,800
Hey, isn't that Mo Fan?

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,440
He turned in his exam so early.

35
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,740
He must not have understood the subject matter!

36
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,480
I thought it was quite difficult.

37
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,920
I couldn't fill in

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,900
all seven uses of Level 1 Light Magic,

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,620
the last question on the exam.

40
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,640
Hey Mu Bai,

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,680
you're smart,

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,320
you must have gotten all of them!

43
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,300
It's just an entrance exam on basic theory

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,720
for Magic Senior High School.

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
The key is what talent we'll receive

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,340
during the Magic Awakening.

47
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,980
Of course,

48
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,580
those who don't pass the exam will never be Mages.

49
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,280
Mu Bai, you'll be fine,

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,100
your entire family has the Ice talent,

51
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,580
you'll definitely be Ice-talented, too!

52
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,580
Ice is powerful.

53
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,580
I hope I get it, too.

54
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,120
Fire is better.

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,600
But it's really rare.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,540
I heard Fire is still not the most powerful.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,860
Dad, what are you doing here?

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,360
To pick you up.

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
How did your exam go?

61
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,100
What a mess!

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,960
I studied for three whole months,

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,740
but the exam covered nine years of material!

64
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,200
How was I supposed to pass it?

65
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,100
Don't worry,

66
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,000
I found you a job as a driver to the neighboring city.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Uncle Guangfeng will teach you,

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,140
and the salary is good.

69
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,140
4,000 to 5,000 a month!

70
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,280
It's not bad

71
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,200
to start working when you're young.

72
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,860
Dad, I want to study!

73
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,560
I mean, I want to be a Mage!

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,880
I know being a Mage is a good path.

75
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
You have plans,

76
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,760
and you don't want to be a driver like me.

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,820
But you know that your exam results

78
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,920
aren't high enough to meet the entrance requirement.

79
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm serious!

80
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
I don't want to be a miserable loser

81
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,600
either in the old world or in the Magic world.

82
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,060
Well,

83
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,840
if you're serious about it, I'll think of something.

84
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,100
Dad, thank you!

85
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,660
I'll become a great Mage

86
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,660
who is respected by everyone!

87
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,340
Good.

Right bro,

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,800
Mu Ningxue has come back from the Capital!

92
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,060
I saw her this morning,

93
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,820
she's even prettier than before!

94
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh.

95
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,340
Yo, what, no response?

96
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,460
How should I respond?

97
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,320
Mo Fan, wait for me!

98
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,960
Come on, are you not excited at all?

99
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Mr. Mu,

100
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,200
please do me a favor.

101
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
Please!

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
I know you can get them to admit my son

103
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,480
if you talk to them.

104
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,260
Mo Jiaxing,

105
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,300
it's one thing for your son to fail an exam,

106
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,180
but he once tried to elope with the heiress of Mu Family!

107
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,520
So tell me,

108
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,420
why should I help you after what happened?

109
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,020
It was indeed Mo Fan's fault,

110
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,480
he shouldn't have done that.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,480
Fortunately we found them pretty soon,

112
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,260
and no one was hurt.

113
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,380
He didn't do anything to Miss Mu.

114
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,720
I've faithfully served the Mu Family all these years,

115
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,420
please help me one last time!

116
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,140
My son is serious about becoming a Mage!

117
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,520
It's too late for that,

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,320
a failure is a failure!

119
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,780
You should have educated him better

120
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,240
if you wanted him to pass.

121
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Without my help last time,

122
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,060
you'd have already been kicked out!

123
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,920
Your son might be too young and dumb to understand it,

124
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,560
but you're an adult who's worked for a long time,

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,060
don't you understand that

126
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,180
Miss Mu is way out of your league?

127
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,740
He really wants to be a Mage!

128
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,020
Mr. Mu,

129
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,820
I'm willing to do anything

130
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,300
if... if you help me!

131
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Oh? You really mean it?

132
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,120
Master Mu has always wanted you to move away.

133
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,840
Getting admitted to Magic School is expensive,

134
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,680
but it costs more than money.

135
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,560
Well, I'll consider it if you

136
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,840
pledge your house to me.

137
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,960
Pledge my house to you?

138
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,220
Your house is a dump,

139
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,800
but the land isn't.

140
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,200
Deal.

141
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,960
What's wrong?

142
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,480
What is wrong with the world?

143
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,240
How is it so cruel?

144
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,980
The poor and weak are always bullied!

145
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,540
Son, I have good news!

146
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,080
I got you admitted to Magic School!

147
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,860
Eat.

148
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,080
You did?

149
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,440
One of my classmates

150
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,000
happens to be the director there,

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,640
he promised me to get you in!

152
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,260
Promise me you'll study harder.

153
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,920
Son, I believe in you!

154
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,560
Okay.

155
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,140
Oh, one more thing.

156
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,840
I plan to rent the house out

157
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,480
while you're in school.

158
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,860
I'm always driving for work,

159
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,420
Xinxia lives at school,

160
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,120
the house will be empty

161
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,680
if you live at school, too.

162
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay.

163
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,600
So, I heard that Miss Mu is back?

164
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,160
Dad, all I can think of now is to study Magic,

165
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,500
to earn a lot of money for you and Xinxia,

166
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,760
and to buy houses for you all to live in!

167
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,240
Your son is going to be the greatest Mage ever!

168
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,380
Good! Good!

You...

171
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,380
Mo Fan, let's go.

172
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,860
But... To where?

173
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,940
Wherever, as long as it's not here!

174
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,280
Alright then.

175
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,200
Mo Jiaxing!

176
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,720
Your son's got some stones!

177
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,280
He tried to elope with Ningxue!

178
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,560
Does he have a death wish?

179
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,580
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

180
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,800
it's all my fault!

181
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,500
Please just punish me.

182
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,920
Forgive Mo Fan!

183
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
He's just a dumb child.

184
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,360
A child?

185
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,580
Pretty clever for a child!

186
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,020
He tried to seduce and kidnap my daughter!

187
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,680
Mo Fan, this is your last warning.

188
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,420
I'll break your legs one by one

189
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,920
if you see her again!

190
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,340
= Welcome =

191
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,440
Students,

192
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,000
today is your first day at Sky Magic High School.

193
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,740
Welcome to the haven of magic!

194
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,980
I didn't realize we have our Magic Awakening today.

195
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,440
I'm nervous!

196
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,500
Me, too!

197
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,640
I want to become a Wind Mage.

198
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,520
I hope Wind will become my talent.

199
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,520
Wind is useless!

200
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,140
Fire is where it's at.

201
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,460
But only a few people can awaken it.  -Cheer up, man!

202
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,160
Only two or three in each class.  -You'll receive a powerful talent! Yes!

203
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,560
= Sky Magic High School =

204
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,340
This badge is very important.
= Class 8 Grade 1 =

205
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,860
Students,

206
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,700
when your talent is awoken,

207
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,580
the badge will change to its corresponding color.

208
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,460
Cyan corresponds to Wind,

209
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,140
red corresponds to Fire,

210
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,720
gold corresponds to Light.

211
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,420
What?

212
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,600
No. 48, Mo Fan,

213
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,420
the last one.

214
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,900
You're lucky to be here.

215
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,317
Called in a favor, eh?

216
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,000
You jerk, leave him alone!

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,140
We all know that he could never pass the exam!

218
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,140
He'll embarrass himself

219
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,360
if he can't awaken a talent.

220
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,840
Man, ignore him.

221
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
You can awaken a powerful talent!

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
Powerful?

223
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,820
He'll be lucky if he can awaken that weak Light talent.

224
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,920
He can't compare with Mu Bai!

225
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,260
Mu Bai, put your right hand on the Crystal Ball,

226
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,240
and focus.

227
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,920
Yes sir.

228
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,140
You're from the Mu Family?

229
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,300
I hope you'll awaken Ice.

230
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,360
Let's begin!

231
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,220
Amazing!

232
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
Ice talent!

233
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,820
Yeah!

234
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,740
Mu Bai has awoken the Ice talent!

235
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,300
The stars on the badge

236
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
will show the strength of your talent.

237
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,680
Usually there are 7 dark stars after Awakening.

238
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,500
But Mu Bai has one bright star,

239
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,840
meaning that his talent is more powerful.

240
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,160
He's handsome and talented!

241
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,100
He's smart!

242
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,640
Wow.

243
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,820
Nice, I want the Ice talent, too!

244
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,940
Why is this loser here again?

245
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,100
No worries,

246
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,780
I'll show him how useless he is.

247
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,420
Alright, next, No. 2!

248
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,760
= Wind =

249
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,820
= Earth =

250
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,580
= Water =

251
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,300
= Light =

252
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,520
None of the others had a bright star.

253
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,120
It's my turn.

254
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,920
No. 48, Mo Fan.

255
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,720
That's Mo Fan?

256
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,340
I heard he had to pull a favor to get in.

257
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,220
That's right!

258
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,260
Don't be sad

259
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,080
if you awoke a Light or Water talent!

260
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,600
At least you are better than him!

261
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,640
Alright, put your right hand on it.

262
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,980
Relax,

263
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
keep your hand stable,

264
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,780
or it won't work.

265
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,160
So he's the transfer student.

266
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
I hope he awakens something,

267
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,160
otherwise everybody will laugh at me!

268
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,740
Come on!

269
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,080
I'll even take a Light talent!

270
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,760
Anything is better than failing!

271
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,820
What?

272
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,100
It's purple?

273
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,700
Cyan for Wind,

274
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,840
blue for Water,

275
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,140
brown for Earth,

276
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,340
gold for Light,

277
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,820
red for Fire,

278
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,240
but what does purple correspond to?!

279
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,760
Thunder!

280
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,400
The Thunder talent!

281
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,980
Someone has awoken Thunder!

282
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,420
What?! Thunder?! For real?

283
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:39,980
Let's go see.

284
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,540
No way!

285
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,100
Barely 1 in 1,000 people can awaken Thunder!

286
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,420
It's really the Thunder talent!

287
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,440
He's the only one among all the students!

288
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,160
Amazing!

289
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,300
Fire talent?

290
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,620
It can't compete with Thunder at all!

291
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,660
A Thunder talent?

292
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,260
His teacher must be thrilled!

293
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,020
After all, Thunder is the most powerful element.

294
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,511
Make way, make way.

295
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,553
Don't push.  -Let me have a look.

296
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,596
It's really the Thunder talent!

297
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,764
Please excuse me.

298
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,307
